# Obsidian Super Plan

> âš  This plugin is in its early stages and is still under development. 

An Obsidian plugin that helps you plan your day with full productivity.

The plugin is based on [SuperMemo Plan](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan). If you are unfamiliar
with it, you can get started by exploring the following resources:

- [Plan in SuperMemo](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Plan)
- [Planning a perfect productive day without stress](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Planning_a_perfect_productive_day_without_stress)

## Limitations

1. Currently the plugin is not compatible with plugins that interact with the Markdown table, e.g.
   [obsidian-advanced-table](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian), [ob-table-enhancer](https://github.com/Stardusten/ob-table-enhancer).

2. The algorithm used for scheduling may differ from the original SuperMemo Plan and is still
   undergoing improvement.

## Installation

To install the plugin, simply download the latest zip file from the [Github Releases page](https://github.com/Z233/obsidian-super-plan/releases/latest), and extract the contents to the plugins folder in your Obsidian vault.
